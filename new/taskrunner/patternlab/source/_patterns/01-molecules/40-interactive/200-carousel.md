Title: Carousel
---

Carousels are a series of divs which are turned into slides. This was designed to use the "media with caption" component. Other components might work but compatibility might require some tweaking. Carousels can present some challenging UX and accessibility issues and their use should be limited, especially if all of the content in the carousel is important. 

There are two styles provided: 

* `carousel--single`: One slide fills the available space
* `carousel--center`: Previous and next carousels peak out of the edge on screens > large; medium and small screen treatment is similar to `carousel--single`
