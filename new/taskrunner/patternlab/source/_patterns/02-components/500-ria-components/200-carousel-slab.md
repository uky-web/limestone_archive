# Title: Carousel Slab
# ---

The carousel slab is used to present a series of figures with captions; current designs support that, but the pattern can be tweaked to use other components. Because of the difficulty keyboard users have navigating within carousels it's best not to add components that have interactions within the slides.

The slab supports an h2 headline with an introductory paragraph which does not change as the slides change. Carousel styles (single or center) should be set on the individual carousel.
