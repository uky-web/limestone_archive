Title: Block List
---

The Block List layout is a mini-slab layout that eliminates the top padding of the first slab and bottom padding of the last slab; it is best for sidebars or other similar parts of the layout. UXPin says "up to five of the same component" but it can actually be a mix of elements. Recommend using the `slab--wildcat-white` style instead of the others and letting blocks determine their own color scheme where possible.
