Title: Hero Page Header
---

Page header with a full-width hero image. The title space has a number of options, with different background colors controlled by the slab style class name; there are options for CTAs and a secondary image to accompany the title.

*Ambient Video* : You can add ambient video in place of the featured image. This loads on screens larger than 1024, and should not try to load unless the screen is that large (sparing mobile devices). Try not to send too large a video this way. 

*Content Fitting Concern* : If the title is too long, the secondary image does not provide enough vertical space and a gap will open below the image and the headline container border.
