Title: Profile
---

This is the page for an individual profile. It is similar in many ways to the basic editorial page, but it offers an additional contact information block.

Depending on your needs, the CMS may be reconfigured to provide a far more structured approach to profiles -- with separate sections for biography, background, etc -- but it is possible to present this information in a more organic way through the WYSIWYG. In this example we have structured just enough information to feed smaller content blocks and the profile list table.
