Title: Page
---

The "Page" layout is used primarily for editorial or landing style pages. It is built as a sort of editorial "sandwich." The "bread" at the top and bottom of the page are full-page slabs; the middle section provides space for more traditional long-form text with a sidebar. 

All of these sections should be optional; if you want a primarily editorial page, you can leave the top and bottom regions empty; if you want a landing page with no sidebar, you can leave the middle section empty. 

We have not explicitly defined a "top," "middle," or "bottom" section in the markup, however -- it is more of a layout convention than it is a semantic collection. Instead, the editorial / sidebar combination is treated as a slab. This maximizes future flexibility.
