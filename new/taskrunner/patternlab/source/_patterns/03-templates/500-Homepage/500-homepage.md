Title: Home Page Mockup
---
This extends the page layout to set up a new playground for newer design standards for UK. This will be where the main Home Page design is laid out for the UK campus.

All of these sections should be optional; if you want a primarily editorial page, you can leave the top and bottom regions empty; if you want a landing page with no sidebar, you can leave the middle section empty.

We have not explicitly defined a "top," "middle," or "bottom" section in the markup, however -- it is more of a layout convention than it is a semantic collection. Instead, the editorial / sidebar combination is treated as a slab. This maximizes future flexibility.
