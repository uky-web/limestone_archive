Event

This is the page for an event. It is paired in the CMS with a structured event content type. Unlike the generic "page" content type, we are not anticipating having full-width slabs at the top and the bottom of the content. 

It is very similar to the "News" content type by design; the primary difference is a change in the content meta information below the headline, which shows location and event time rather than Author and byline.
