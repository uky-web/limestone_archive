Title: Unordered List
---

Basic text arranged in a list. Usually with bullets, but not always.

Variables:

* _num_items_ : set an integer to generate that number of sample list items. Works poorly in combination with _content_ or _content_list_item_. Default: 7.
* _sample_as_links_ : Use with _num_items_, set to true to generate a dummy list of links.
* _style_modifier_ : Additional class styles. Provide examples of these in Patternlab by creating a matching json file.
* _items_ : List of items in the list:
	* _content_ : Text inside the list item. Default: `fake(bs)`
	* _linked_ : Set to true to wrap the list item in a link
