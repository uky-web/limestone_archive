Title: Paragraph
---

Simple text wrapped with a paragraph.

Variables:

* _content_ : Text inside the paragraph. Default: `fake(paragraph)`
* _paragraph_variant_ : Additional class styles. Provide examples of these in Patternlab by creating a matching json file.
* _numParagraphs_ : Convenience variable to create several paragraphs. Works poorly in combination with _content_ or _content_paragraph_. Default: 1.

Blocks:

* _content_paragraph_ : Override this block if you have complex content for the paragraph (such as inset images, etc).
