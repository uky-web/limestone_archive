Title: Universal Footer
---

The universal footer should be the last thing on every page. It has a single navigation-like structure at the bottom that includes a copyright statement and any legally required statements. 

The pattern has one variation that includes the University of Kentucky wordmark; this should be used on any site that is not the main site, and it should always link to the main site. The universal footer on the main site should remove it because it is redundant.
