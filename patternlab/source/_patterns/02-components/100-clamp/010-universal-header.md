Title: Universal Header
---

The universal header appears on all sites except the main university site. The left side has a "site breadcrumb" that shows the university logo and wordmark and the parent site of the current site only (dropping any grandparent orgs, etc). 

On the right, there is a link to MyUK and a search modal.
