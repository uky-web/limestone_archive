Icon with Label
---

Short text with an icon on the left or the right. If this needs to be a link or a button it should be wrapped in the appropriate markup.

Variables:

* _icon_ : the name of the icon. The name is assembled from the folder and file name in the `svgstore` directory. `design/cog-box` becomes `design--cog-box`.
* _icon_right_ : As above, but locates the icon on the right of the text instead of the left.
* _label_ : The text that displays with the icon.
* _icon_alt : Alternative descriptive text used as the label for the icon SVG.
