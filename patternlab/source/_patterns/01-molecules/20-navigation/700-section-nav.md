Title: Section Nav
---

Section navigation is a menu structure. It can display a parent page, current page, sibling pages, and child pages.

For all pages with section navigation:

* Backlink to parent page shows. If this is the home page it should read "Home."
* The current page is shown. 
* Sibling pages are shown on desktop only. They are hidden in the mobile section navigation. This is handled with CSS.
* Child pages are shown indented under the current page.
