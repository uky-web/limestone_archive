el: ".align-left"
title: "Align Left"

This aligns text to the left but applies no other styles. It is used in instances where you need spot-control over text layout. It should probably not be used in templates -- a more focused class should be used instead.

`align-left` is, of course, the default; it is included in case you need to nest it inside another alignment container.
